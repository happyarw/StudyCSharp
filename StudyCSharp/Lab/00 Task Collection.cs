        // Here you'll find my task collection, i've done so far.
        // Every task has a purpouse, so you can learn something from it, it can be anything like datastructure or algorithms.

        // If you are new to programming, like me :), you can do this, you are already doing great! 
        // So lets have some fun. :)

        // NOTE: You'll find the solutions in the .cs Files.

         * 01 Calculate Sum
         * For the beginning of this journey, we are starting lightly.
         * 
         * Calculate the sum of a given array.
         *
         * RULES:
         * > give an int back
         * > handle the case where the array is NULL or empty
         */

         * 02 Find Max Number 
         * Another easy one. You already have got everything you need, just change some lines.

         * This might look like a biiiig jump, but bare with me, it might be easier than you think.
         * 
         * Let's get you familiar with Lists and HashSets.
